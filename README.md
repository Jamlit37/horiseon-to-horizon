# horiseon-to-horizon
Welcome to my first challenge. Lots of different aspects learnt here and still a long way to go. 
Found some elements that when changed I was not able to reverse the site to its original state so had to copy the starting code. 
New things learnt which was my main out take from this assignment and hoping I follow the criteria coorrectly.
Had to make it more accessible so that people who could possibly have bad eyesight, be colour blind or use keyboard to operate the webpage
